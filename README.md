# Forza-Horizon-5-Auction-House-Sniper
Please note that this bot does not bid on the cars on the auction house but instead buys out the car, in addition this bot does not garentee the successful purchase of a car from the auction house nor does it garentee a successful wining buyout of a car, it simply just allows you to try and snipe cars while you are not at your computer. 

**To Stop the program you can either click on the button on the bottom right of your screen labelled with "Scruffydrew パン" or you can close the console or end it in task manager.**

**The program will continuously snipe cars for you so can leave it over night and potentially come back to multiple purchases of cars.**

Before launching the application you need to setup a few things, don't worry this isnt anything substantial, but you will need to do this each time you run the program.

Step 1:

  Move to the screen shown above.
  
Step 2:

  Enter the auction house, your screen should look something like the image above.
  
Step 3:

  Enter the search function for the auction house and change the settings to your desired configuration,
  
  In the image above I selected Koenigsegg as the brand/make of the car  and the Jesko as the model of car I wanted to search for. I then set the max buyout to 1,000,000 CR as I wanted to try and snipe a Koenigsegg Jesko that was equal to or less than 1,000,000 CR.
  
  But this will work for any configuration, I just used the above as an example.
  
Step 4:
  
  Confim your search configuration and back out of the search.

  After doing so your screen should now look like something similar to the image above.
  
Step 5: 
  
  Run the program and click back into Forza Horizon 5, and move your curson somewhere where it wont be able to select anything on screen, this can be somewhere on a second monitor   (if you have one) or a good place to move it to is the top left hand corner of your screen.
  
  **At all times you must be clicked into Forza Horizon 5 otherwise the program will not work as it just simulates keyboard presses to create a sort of macro that is able to make decisions on what it should do based on what it can see on your screen**

When you Run the program for the first time Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will prevent it from running and will display the above image on your screen (it may be a different colour but it will be the same text).

When this comes up click on More info

After clicking on More info the pop-up will look something similar to the above image, just may be a different colour depending on your what you have your colours set to in your settings.

Just click on the button labeled Run anyway, this will run the program.
